      <p class="text-white"> A blog (a shortened version of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website displaying information in reverse chronological order,
          with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers
          share their views on an individual subject.
          Today, there are more than 570 million blogs on the web. The number of bloggers in the USA alone is set to reach 31.7 million
          users by 2020.
          There are many reasons to start a blog for personal use and only a handful of strong ones for business blogging. Blogging for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has a very straightforward purpose – to rank your website higher in Google SERPs, a.k.a. increase your visibility.
          As a business, you rely on consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business, you rely on blogging to help you get to potential consumers and grab their attention. Without blogging, your website would remain invisible, whereas running a blog makes you searchable and competitive.
          So, the main purpose of a blog is to connect you to the relevant audience. Another one is to boost your traffic and send quality leads to your website.
          The more frequent and better your blog posts are, the higher the chances for your website to get discovered and visited by your target audience. This means that a blog is an effective lead generation tool. Add a great call to action (CTA) to your content, and it will convert your website traffic into
          high-quality leads. A blog also allows you to showcase your niche authority and build a brand.
